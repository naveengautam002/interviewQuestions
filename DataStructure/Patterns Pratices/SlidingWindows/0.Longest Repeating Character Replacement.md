Question:

424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement

You are given a string s and an integer k. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most k times.

Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
Example 2:

Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
There may exists other ways to achieve this answer too.

Approach
```
1. taking 2 variable, first to keep maxLen
2. to keep the maximum count character, only that will be the main character other will be replaceable, and i am keep trace of that when adding in map while iteration. which is maxCharCurrent
```


My Solution
```java
    public int characterReplacement(String s, int k) {
        int maxLen = 0;
        int maxCharCurrent =0;
        int start = 0;
        Map<Character, Integer> m = new HashMap<>();
        for (int end=0;end<s.length();end++) {
            if (m.containsKey(s.charAt(end))) {
                int c = m.get(s.charAt(end))+1;
                m.put(s.charAt(end), c);
                maxCharCurrent = Math.max(maxCharCurrent, c);
            } else {
                m.put(s.charAt(end), 1);
                maxCharCurrent = Math.max(maxCharCurrent, 1);
            }

            while(end-start+1-maxCharCurrent > k) {
                int c= m.get(s.charAt(start));
                if (c == 1) {
                    m.remove(s.charAt(start));
                } else {
                    m.put(s.charAt(start), c-1);
                }
                start++;
            }
            maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, end-start+1);
        }
        return maxLen;
    }
