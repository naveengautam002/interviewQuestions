Problem:
Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window 
substring
 of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.

```txt
Example 1:

Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
Example 2:

Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
Example 3:

Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
```

### Approach: 
1. calculate all words frequency in 26 length array of t word.
2. now expend the window one by one and keep another frequency array for string s now.
3. we need to compress the window when
```txt
a. frequency array values of s are greater or equal to frequency array values of t string
b. left side of window pointer value is not in t string.
```

```java
class Solution {
    public String minWindow(String t, String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int[] arr = new int[59];
        int minLen = 100000;
        int resultS=-1;
        int resultE=-1;
        for (int i=0;i<n;i++) {
            arr[s.charAt(i)-'A']+=1;
        }
        int start = 0;
        int[] wArr = new int[59];
        for (int end = 0;end<t.length();end++) {
            if (arr[t.charAt(end)-'A'] > 0 ) {
                wArr[t.charAt(end)-'A']+=1;
            }
            boolean hit = isHit(arr, wArr);
            while ((hit || arr[t.charAt(start)-'A']<1) && start <= end) {
                if (hit) {
                    if (minLen > end-start+1) {
                        minLen = end-start+1;
                        resultS = start;
                        resultE = end;
                    }
                }
                if (arr[t.charAt(start)-'A'] > 0) {
                    wArr[t.charAt(start)-'A']-=1;
                }
                start++;
                hit = isHit(arr, wArr);
            }
        }
        if (resultS == -1) {
            return "";
        }
        return t.substring(resultS, resultE+1);
    }

    public boolean isHit(int[] a, int[] b) {
        for (int i=0;i<59;i++) {
            if (a[i]>b[i]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
