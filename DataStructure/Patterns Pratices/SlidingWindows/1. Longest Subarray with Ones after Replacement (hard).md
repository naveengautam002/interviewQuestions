Question (Medium)
```yml
Given a binary array nums and an integer k, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most k 0's.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
0 <= k <= nums.length
```
My Solution
```
class Solution {
    public int longestOnes(int[] nums, int k) {
        int totalZeros=0;
        int start =0;
        int maxLen = 0;
        for (int end = 0;end<nums.length;end++) {
            if (nums[end] == 0)
                totalZeros++;
            
            while(totalZeros > k) {
                if (nums[start]==0)
                    totalZeros--;
                start++;
            }

            maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, end-start+1);
        }
        return maxLen;
    }
}
```
